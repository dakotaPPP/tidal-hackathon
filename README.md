# SmartScore

SmartScore is an innovative software developed by our team, which secured an impressive 4th position out of 64 competing teams in a university-wide artificial intelligence and machine learning hackathon. The team, comprised of Adam Chawdhury, Johnnie Chen, Julio Dondisch, and Dakota Pound, collaborated to create a powerful tool that automates the grading process for free response questions in math and physics exams.

## Features

- **Handwritten Text Recognition (OCR):** SmartScore utilizes Optical Character Recognition to convert handwritten responses into LaTeX format, ensuring accurate interpretation of students' answers.

- **Automatic Grading:** The software automates the grading process, enabling efficient evaluation of free response questions in math and physics exams.

- **Database Management:** SmartScore manages classes and stores students' answers in a SQLite database, providing a structured and organized way to access and review the data.

- **Python Implementation:** Developed using Python, SmartScore leverages the language's versatility and robust libraries to create a reliable and efficient grading system.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** The software takes free response answers from students, whether handwritten or typed.

2. **OCR Processing:** Handwritten responses are processed using OCR, converting them into LaTeX for accurate interpretation.

3. **Grading Algorithm:** SmartScore employs a sophisticated grading algorithm to evaluate the correctness and quality of the answers.

4. **Database Storage:** Student information, class details, and graded responses are stored in a SQLite database, facilitating easy access and analysis.
